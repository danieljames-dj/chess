TODO:
- Add backup to Google Drive as well
- Try versioning backup
- Get JSON from Google Sheet directly
- Research whether to go for another logger
- Research if simultanous downloads cause any problem
- Re-deploy Openingtree
- Try to avoid two uploading to cloud storage and instead try to make one of them copy from another
